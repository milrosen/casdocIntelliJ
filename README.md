# casdocIntelliJ
my silly little basic Idea for an IntelliJ port of Casdoc

Currently, there are only two inspections that walk a user through creating a Card class. The inspections tool is much more powerful than we need to accomplish this and is as such much too verbose to even begin to imagine a full port of Casdoc to a plugin.

The goal -- broadly -- is to build a superset of the existing Casdoc code commenting system (one that allows for an order of operations) and a plugin that would support visual modification of the lesson plan. This plugin would then build a smaller plugin (or even just a set of inspection rules) that a student could download and set up on their machine,
